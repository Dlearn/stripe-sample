## Stripe APIs

This repository creates a simple store that allows users to purchase items.

When the user proceeds to the Checkout Page, the browser calls the server with the items in the cart. The server calls Stripe to create a PaymentIntent, which is returned and stored in the browser to make the final payment.

Although the order summary table shows what items are in the cart and how much will be charged, the amount is recalculated with the item prices on the server to create the Payment Intent. This ensures that the user cannot tamper with the browser or request to manipulate the amount.

These features have been implemented on the website:

### 1. Stripe.js Available Everywhere

To best leverage Stripe‚Äôs advanced fraud functionality, the Stripe.js package is loaded in the root of the App. This allows Stripe to detect suspicious behavior that may be indicative of fraud as customers browse the website.

`import '@stripe/stripe-js';`

### 2. Stripe Elements

For simplicity, this website uses Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt UI components for the checkout flow. Stripe Elements allows for easier integration of [other Payment Requests](#other-payment-requests).

### 3. 3D Secure

If 3DS is required, then Stripe Radar will automatically trigger the authentication flow in a modal pop-up.

### 4. Confirmation Email

The user must fill in their email address to receive a receipt of their purchase.

## Other Considerations for an E-Commerce Store

These features are not implemented in this website, but are possible extensions.

### 1. Saving Credit Card Details

To minimize friction for the user, the company should save the credit card details for subsequent payments. This has not been implemented for this website because user accounts have not been implemented. Furthermore, to test locally, one would need to configure a proxy to test autofill due to browser's https rules, which is out of the scope of this simple website.

### 2. Other Payment Requests

With Stripe Elements, Apple Pay, Google Pay and other payment requests can easily be implemented to allow users other forms of payment.

### 3. Language and Currency Localization

E-commerce shops that operate in multiple countries have to implement both language and currency localization for their shops. For this website, the language is English, and the currency is USD.

### 4. Subscriptions

Some e-commerce shops implement subscriptions where the user's card is saved, and the user is charged at a regular interval (every month). This is supported by Stripe, but has not been implemented in this website.

## How can we prevent double charging?

There are several ways a user can be double charged for their transaction. These are some of the cases and how they are addressed:

1. User clicks on submit twice

Once the submit button is clicked, subsequent clicks of the submit button will be disabled. Submitting the form twice should be impossible. But if the user somehow submits the form twice, the client would send the same `clientSecret`. Stripe will throw an exception for the 2nd submit request, and the user will not be charged twice.

2. User submits the form, the request goes through, but the client does not transition to the success page, and the user submits the form again

In the unlikely case that this happens, the client would send the same `clientSecret`. Similarly, Stripe will throw an exception for the 2nd submit request, and the user will not be charged twice.
